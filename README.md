# Gentoo-wsl
Basic repo for my Gentoo setup configurations working in WSL (WSL1 compatible)

I leave it here for me to track changes to my configurations and as a reference if someone needs it.

I'm sorry, this setup uses clang as main c/c++ compiler.

**Please use this repo only as a reference and not directly as-it-is.**

To use this repo use mount --bind of your root filesystem into the dir root. I intentionally won't leave an explicit example on how to do that because it can be harmful for your system.
